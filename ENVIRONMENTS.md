#Environments
Following a 3-tier DSP model for all technology projects.

##Development
Working code copy. Changes made by developers are deployed here so integration and features can be tested. This environment is rapidly updated and contains the most recent version of the application.

##Staging
This is the release candiate, and is normally a minor of the production version. This environment is used for final stress testing, quality assurance and client approvals, before going to production.

##Production
This is the current released and live version for application/website, accessible to users and client. This version preferably does not change except for during scheduled releases.
