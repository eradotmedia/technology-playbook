# Releasing for iOS

Steps for releasing a new version of your app:

1. Switch to the `master` branch.
2. Bump the projects version number (make sure to use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/)).
3. Create and upload the archive to TestFlight.
4. Create a [release on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/). Remember to mark it as a `pre-release` if needed.
